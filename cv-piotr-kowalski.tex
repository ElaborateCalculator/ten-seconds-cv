        \textbf{Thesis}: Data Integration from Multiple Historical Sources to Study Canadian Casualties of WWI
        {\begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed a scalable stepwise deterministic method to reliably integrate datasets without labeled data. The method performs comparably with a method that incorporates a Support Vector Machine
        \item Constructed a rich longitudinal dataset to enable comphrehensive time-series analyses about WWI Canadian society and military
        \item \textbf{Tools}: R, Python, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib \vspace{2mm}

\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
